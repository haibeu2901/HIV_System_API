# Token Guard Implementation Status

## ✅ Pages Now Protected

The following critical pages now have token validation implemented:

### User Pages
- ✅ `private-view/user-view/appointment-view/view-appointment.html`
- ✅ `private-view/user-view/booking/appointment-booking.html`
- ✅ `private-view/user-view/profile/profile.html`
- ✅ `private-view/user-view/medical-record/view-medical-record.html`
- ✅ `private-view/user-view/notification/notification.html`

### Admin Pages
- ✅ `private-view/admin-view/admin-home/admin-home.html`

### Doctor Pages
- ✅ `private-view/doctor-view/doctor-dashboard/doctor-dashboard.html`

### Staff Pages
- ✅ `private-view/staff-view/staff-dashboard/staff-dashboard.html`

### Manager Pages
- ✅ `private-view/manager-view/manager-home/manager-home.html`

## 🔒 What This Fixes

**Before:** Users could access private pages even without valid tokens, as seen in your screenshot.

**After:** 
- ❌ **No token = Immediate redirect** to landing page before page loads
- ❌ **Invalid token = API validation fails = Immediate logout and redirect**
- ❌ **Network errors = Zero tolerance = Immediate logout**
- ✅ **Valid token = Access granted + continuous monitoring**

## 🧪 Test Instructions

1. **Clear your localStorage**: 
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console on any private page and run:
   localStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```
   → Should redirect to landing page immediately

2. **Set invalid token**:
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console and run:
   localStorage.setItem('token', 'invalid_token_123');
   location.reload();
   ```
   → Should redirect after API validation fails

3. **Normal access**: Login normally → Should work as expected

## 📋 Remaining Pages to Check

If you have other private pages that aren't listed above, add this line before other scripts:

```html
<!-- Token validation guard - Must be first script -->
<script src="../../shared/token-guard.js"></script>
```

**Note:** Adjust the path based on the page's location relative to `private-view/shared/`

## 🚨 Why You Could Still Access Before

The issue was that **many private pages were missing the token guard script**. Each page needs to explicitly include `token-guard.js` to be protected. The pages I've updated now have this protection.

## ✅ Current Status

Your appointment view page (and other critical pages) are now fully protected. Try clearing your localStorage and refreshing any of these pages - you should be immediately redirected to the landing page.
